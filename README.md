# Advent of Code 2023
---
## Disclaimer
2nd year solving it as a TypeScript developer. Instead solving the AOC tasks urgently and any way, I will try to write perfect TS code. Sorry Santa, you'll be late if I am your soft-eng choice this year, too.
If you sneak into the project probably you will see very stupid and ugly lines or solutions. But, that is ok. Even more, you are invited to do a review and piss on my code as much as you want.

## Prerequisites
TypeScript
Node.js

---
## Setting the project
Just clone/checkout.
The data is stored in TXT files in ./inputs

---
## Run
`$ npm install`

`$ npm run start`

Use the CLI app.
